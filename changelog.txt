Add skeleton recipes to REI
Skeleton health is now shown in the skeleton GUI
Skeleton health is now data driven - pack makers can add or change recipes to provide more or less health than the default.
- Each component (skin, muscles, player colors) can add on to health
- Muscles now add 4 health, and skin now adds 2, by default.
Added augments:
- Sturdy: Reduces damage from sources other than Fire or Magic, and takes more damage from Magic.
- Fireproof: Skeleton is immune to Fire damage but takes a little more damage from other sources.
The description in Mod Menu can now be translated.
